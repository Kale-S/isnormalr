\description{
This function is a suite of functions that can be used to compute
some of the regression (leve-one-out deletion) diagnostics for a
linear models discussed in Belsley, Kuh and Welsch (1980),
Cook and Weisberg (1982)
}
\details{
\strong{Hat_Values / Lavarage Values}
  are a measure of the effect of a particular observation
  on the regression predictions due to the position of that
  observation in the space of the inputs. In general, the farther
  a point is from the center of the input space, the more leverage
  it has. Because the sum of the leverage values is p, an
  observation i can be considered as an outlier if its leverage
  substantially exceeds the mean leverage value, p/n, for example,
  a value larger than 2*p/n.


\strong{Cooks distance}
  is a measure of an observation or instancesâ€™
  influence on a linear regression. Instances with a large influence
  may be outliers and datasets that have a large number of highly
  influential points might not be good predictors to fit linear models.

The \strong{Standardized residuals}
  is the residual divided by its standard
  error. Standardization is a method of transforming data so that
  its mean value is zero and the standard deviation is one. If the
  distribution of residuals is approximately normal, then 95% of the
  standardized residuals should lie between -2 and +2, if many of the
  residuals lie outside + or - 2, then they might be considered
  unusual. However, about 5% of the residuals could happen to be
  outside this region.

The \strong{Studentized residuals}
  take into account that the variance of
  the predicted value used in calculating residuals is not constant.
  The variability of cases close to the sample mean for an
  independent variable have smaller variance compared to cases
  further away from the mean. The studentized residual takes this
  change in variability into account by dividing the observed
  residual by an estimate of the standard deviation of the residual
  at that point. Norusis argues that this adjustment makes violation
  of regression assumptions more visible, so it is preferred to
  standardized residuals.
