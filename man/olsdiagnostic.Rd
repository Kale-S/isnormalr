\usage{
olsdiagnostic(object, normtest = "Shapiro-Wilk", pval = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{linear regression model from class 'lm'}

\item{normtest}{the type of normality test. Possible test are

'Shapiro-Wilk', 'Jarque-Bera' or 'Anderson-Darling'}

\item{pval}{p-value for the hypothesis test. Default is 0.05}
}
\value{
A olsdiagnosticR class with following entries:


 \strong{Normality_Tests:}

 This could be the Shapiro-Wilk test, Jarque-Bera test,
 Anderson-Darling test or Cramer-von-mises test.
 Further information can be found in the documentation:

 \code{\link{jarque_bera}}

 \code{\link{anderson_darling_test}}


\strong{Outlier:}

Possible.Outlier:
a data.frame with possible outlier

Cooks.Distance:
a vector with the cook's distance values

Hat.Values

\description{
Regression diagnostics for a linar regression model.
}
\details{
olsdiagnostic was developed for the statistical consulting of the
University of GÃ¶ttingen to assist students in checking common
assumptions of linear regression quickly and easily. It also
provides students with an automated recommendation for the further
procedure if an assumption is not fulfilled.
