# olsdiagnosticR


# Motivation

The R-Package was developed for the statistical consulting of the University of 
GÃ¶ttingen to assist students in checking common assumptions of linear regression quickly
and easily. It also provides students with an automated recommendation for the further 
procedure if an assumption is not fulfilled.

# Installation

You can install the released version of olsdiagnosticR from [git](https://github.com/Kale-S/olsdiagnosticR) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("Kale-S/olsdiagnosticR")
library(olsdiagnosticR)
```

# Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(olsdiagnosticR)
library(carData)
Data <- mtcars
model <- lm(mpg ~. , data = Data)
olsdiagnostic(model)
```
