The R-Package was developed for the statistical consulting of the University of 
GÃ¶ttingen to assist students in checking common assumptions of linear regression quickl
and easily. It also provides students with an automated recommendation for the further 
procedure if an assumption is not fulfilled.

## Installation

You can install the released version of olsdiagnosticR from [git](https://github.com/Kale-S/olsdiagnosticR) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("Kale-S/olsdiagnosticR")
library(olsdiagnosticR)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(olsdiagnosticR)
library(carData)
Data <- mtcars
model <- lm(mpg ~. , data = Data)
olsdiagnostic(model)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(data)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
